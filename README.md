# darts
Scores darts using a simple CLI

Start by entering the end score, typically ending in "01", then enter the players' names.

To score each throw, either enter the score, 
or write it as a mathematical statement.

For example:
```python
>>> 1 + 2 * 3
7
```

The script will respond with a table showing the updated score and current player's name.
